# randomnumbergeneration
This contains two .py files, a linear congruential generator, and a Python script using a middle square algorithm.
A Python program to simulate football matches for 8 teams meeting head to head over 5 weeks, generating scores using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and keeping a leaderboard. The other is a Python script to generate recharge cards using the Middle Square Method. Each card will combine four 4-digit tuples, each generated with separate seeds.
